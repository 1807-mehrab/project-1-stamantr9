"#project-1-stamantr9" 
Project in current state has all user stories besides images. Images is being worked on in a separate copy, but code is broken because of that so this is a working state.
bootstrap is also implemented in separate version but functionality in that one, as stated before, does not exist. Functionality was the priority here for this release.
